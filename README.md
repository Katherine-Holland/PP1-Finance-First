## Introduction
Finance First is the first stop for UK based parents and guardians looking to invest in their children's future. It provides an introduction to the financial products on offer in the UK aimed specifically at children aged between 0 - 18.
The site exists to raise awareness of the financial products on offer to parents and guardians looking to invest for their children and benefit from the tax breaks currently given.

## Design
![Wireframe for Mobile](assets/images/wireframe.png)
The wireframe was created using Balsamiq. I created a basic landing page design which I then used as the basis for my project. https://balsamiq.com/

## Colours
![Colour palette](assets/images/palette.png)
I chose a cool colour palette to give a professional feel to the site. I used websites such as Hargreaves Lansdown https://www.hl.co.uk/ and Point 72 https://point72.com/ as my inspiration. The cool tones flow well together and the blues are calming. Green is also a colour associated with USD and contrasts well with blue.
